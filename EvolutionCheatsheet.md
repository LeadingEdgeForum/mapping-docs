| Stage | I | II | III | IV |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Characteristics
|Ubiquity|Rare|Slowly increasing consumption|Rapidly increasing consumption|Widespread and stabilising|
|Certainty|Poorly Understood|Rapid increases in learning|Rapid increases in use/fit for purpose|Commonly understood in terms of use|
|Publication Types|Normally descrive the wonder of the thing|Build / construct / awareness and learning|Maintenance / operations / installation / features|Focused on Use|
| General properties
|Market|Undefined|Forming|Growing|Mature|
|Knowledge management|Uncertain|Learning on use|Learing on operation| Known / accepted|
|Market perception|Chaotic|Domain of experts|Increasing expectation of use| Ordered / trivial |
|User perception|Different / confusing / exciting / surprising | Leading edge / emerging | Increasingly common, dissapointed if not used | Standard / expected |
|Perception in Industry| Competitive advantage / unpredictable / unknown/ experiment | Competitive advantage / ROI / case examples | Advantage through implementation / features | Cost of doing business |
|Focus on value|  High future worth | Seeking profit / ROI | High profitability | High volume / reducing margin |
|Understanding|  Poorly understood / unpredictable | Increasing understanding / development of measures | Increasing education / constant refinement of needs/measures | Believed to be well defined / stable / measurable |
|Comparison|Constantly changing / a differential / unstable |Learning from others / testing the water / some evidential support | Feature difference | Essential / operational advantage |
|Failure|High/tolerated/assumed | Moderate / unsurprising but dissapointed| Not tolerated/ focus on constant improvement | Operational efficiency and shocked[^1] by failure |
|Market action| Gambling / driven by gut | Exploring a "found" value | Market analysis / listening to customers | Metric driven / build what is needed |
|Efficiency| Reducing the cost of change (Experimentation) | Reducing the cost of waste (Learning) | Reducing the cost of waste (Learning) | Reducing cost of deviation (Volume) |
|Decision drivers| Heritage / culture | Analyses & synthesis | Analyses & synthesis | Previous experience
